/**
  * Global Stylesheet - main.scss
  * This is your global stylesheet.
  * 
  * It is used to define your base styles and variables.
  * This file is imported by settings.json file.
  * Feel free to import some other stylesheets here or in settings.json but
  * keep in mind that order matters!
  * 
  * FYI:
  * - The following styles will be loaded before all your entities stylesheets
  * such as layouts, pages and components, which means that any style here can
  * be overwritten by those definitions in your entities stylesheets.
  * - A good practice is to use the imports/ folder next to this file and put in
  * there the files to be included here with variables, mixins, and so on:
  *   @import imports/variables.scss
  *   @import imports/mixins.scss
